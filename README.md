# Report-Time-Regression
Predicting run time of reports for an Applied Statistics project

ToDo:
* Define business problems
* Engineer features (time stats)
* EDA for interesting points
* Write intro
* Update Readme (to be a readme :)
* Fit all grade rubric criteria into the .rmd file

Cool stuff for later (if we have time):
* write a function to handle XML elements
* add additional features from XMLResponseString (report parameters)
* Shiny app to add/remove parameters for MLR to see impact on predicted run time
